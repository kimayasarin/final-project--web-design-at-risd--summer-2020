   <p> My name is Kimaya Sarin. I am currently a rising junior at Brown University concentrating in Visual Arts. 
   I was born in Bangalore, India and moved to Singapore in Grade 6. Art is something I have been passionate about since I was a little girl. It is something that has always remained constant in my life. My passion for art grew through my last two years of high school where I would spend hours painting in the studio. I knew I wanted to study visual arts before coming to Brown, but being there for two years has only cemented that further. I have experimented with painting, drawing, print-making, mixed-media and lately have been focusing on digital media and design. In the future, I hope to venture into the graphic design field. </p>
